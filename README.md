# Log

day 1 : I complated day 1 and day 2 exercises and reading parts. I learned tuple, set and enums. Enum seems different to me. I am going to try use in future to understand better. 

day 2 : I completed day 3 and 4 reading parts. I memorized my information about loops and conditions. I did not learn much thing from this day

day 5 : I had bad times. Because of that i had to break 2 days. To complete my challange i completed until the 15th days. I learned protocols and extensions. I have trouble with closures but while i was making a project, i will understand closure and use it. I already know optinals.
