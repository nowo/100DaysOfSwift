# Log

day 1 : I complated day 1 and day 2 exercises and reading parts. I learned tuple, set and enums. Enum seems different to me. I am going to try use in future to understand better. 

day 2 : I completed day 3 and 4 reading parts. I memorized my information about loops and conditions. I did not learn much thing from this day

day 3 : I completed until the 15th days. I learned protocols and extensions. I have trouble with closures but while i was making a project, i will understand closure and use it. I already know optinals. I know programming. Because of that i completed 12 lessons in one day

day 4 : I completed day 16 lesson, first part of project 1. I learned uitableview. Uitableview is a subclass of uiview. You must delete uiview before adding uitableview
